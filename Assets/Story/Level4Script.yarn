Knitby: I see the exit! Freedom, fresh air, the stars in the night sky!
// emerging out of the cave
Marshmallow: So, now that we've made it out, I have to ask. 
Marshmallow_faraway: Do you want to keep going, Knitby?
Knitby_confused: Woah, where is all this coming from, Marshmallow?
Marshmallow: Well, to be honest, I started this all braggadocious and <i>"I don't need anyone"</i> or whatever.
Marshmallow: But then you fell, and I had to go it alone, and I realized just how risky this whole thing is.
Marshmallow_faraway: I don't think I can do this without you, Knitby, so if you're out, so am I.
Knitby: Okay, it's my turn to be honest. Because the journey so far was pretty bad.
Marshmallow_faraway: Right, I see how it is.
// marshmallow begins walking down
Knitby: But, it wasn't <i>all</i> bad.
// marshmallow turns around, confused
Marshmallow: Huh?
Knitby: Yes, I did fall off a cliff. Yes, I sat in the bottom of a cave for what felt like forever. And yes, I'm still scared of falling again.
Knitby: But you came back for me, Marshmallow. You saved me. And now that I've experienced the worst outcome possible, I'm feeling braver knowing what to expect. 
Knitby: So I guess what I'm saying is that since we've <i>already</i> come all this way... we might as well see how's the view from the summit.
Marshmallow_smile: YESS!!! And EAT THE CLOUDS!!
Knitby: I still don’t think clouds will taste like cotton candy, though.
Marshmallow: Sounds like I have the rest of the way up to convince you then.
